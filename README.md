# CS 112 Final - Jose's Aim Trainer
This program was designed to help users increase their point and click accuracy.
When you're playing shooting games and want to improve, one universal skill that
transfers between games is the ability to aim. If you improve your aiming skills,
you can spend more time honing your game sense or any other skill. The inspiration
for this software came through a friend who has hundreds of hours on FPS games,
but his aim doesn't reflect those hours. Most players spend a large
amount of time dead and spectating, if this is you, you can now spend that time practicing.
